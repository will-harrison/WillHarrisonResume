I'd like to learn more about the Full Stack Engineer role you have available at Nike. I am an experienced Javascript Developer with a focus on the React ecosystem. I have experience with Node, Express, and Hapi servers. I have a background as a Retail Data Analyst, with 15 years of experience in SQL, and experience with noSql databases like Mongodb and Rethinkdb.

If my skills and experience would add to the team, I'd love to talk more with you about the role.

Thanks,
Will Harrison
